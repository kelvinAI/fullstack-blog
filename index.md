## Welcome to GitHub Pages

## The fullstack developer handy guide to quick deployment
A simple blog to note down the hard learned lessons to fullstack development.

## Setting up production ready nginx server
- Use phusion passenger + nginx + nodejs(or others)

## Nginx configurations
edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, change the lines that read "include sites-enabled/*;" or "include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;" to read 
"include /etc/nginx/sites-available/*;", to avoid needing to symlink every file from /sites-available to /sites-enabled,
which is confusing.

## /etc/nginx/sites-available/xxx.conf
A server block typically looks like this:
```
server
{
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name domain01.com www.domain01.com;

    location /
    {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3626;
        include /etc/nginx/proxy_params;
    }
}

```

the value of server_name is crucial, it must be set to the real web address of the server or else it may not work properly.
eg. server_name www.mydomain.com
